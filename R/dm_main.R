# Search for disease modules from igraph object based on known diseased implicated proteins
# A disease module may exist across functional and topological proteins structures.

# ---------------- Stages:  --------------------
# 1. Create a list of the 26 disease categories using mesh datafile
# 2. Build ppi network using pairwise protein connections from the several databases
# 3. Get genes associated with each disease from "disgene" dataframe.
# 4. Get the drugs associated with each disease.
# 5. Compute statistics relating to diseases and drugs
# 6. Determine topological modules, functional modules and disease modules (hard bit!)

### Stage 1: dm_load_data.R performs stage 1, simply list the mesh categories
meshcats

### Stage 2: Build ppi_net complex network and obtain statistics, we end up with 15,554 proteins 
# with 109,746 edges. build_network.R annotates each gene with its: disease gene status; if targeted by drug;  
ppi_net <- build_network(ppi_hint)
#net_stats <- get_gstatistics(ppi_net)  # statistics takes 10-15 minutes to compute on my laptop.


### Stage 3: every ppi_net protein need annotating with drugs targetted at it (if any)
ppi_net <- annotate_ppi_drugs(ppi_net)


### Stage 4: every ppi_net protein need annotating with implicated diseases (if any)
ppi_net <- annotate_ppi_diseases(ppi_net)


### Stage 5: Compute statistics relating to diseases and drugs
